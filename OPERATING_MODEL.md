# Operating Model

This is the bible the [`captain-picard`](https://github.com/jhgaylor/aod-specs/blob/main/agents/teams/captain-picard/captain-picard.yml) orchestrator reads at the start of every conversation. Keep it tight — anything here that drifts from reality will mislead every dispatch downstream.

Run `/bootstrap` in Claude Code to fill the `<TODO>` blocks below interactively. After that, edit by hand as the product evolves.

---

## Product

**Name:** <TODO: product name>

**Description:** <TODO: one paragraph — what is it, who's it for, why does it exist?>

**Success metric:** <TODO: one line, ideally measurable, defining what "this worked" looks like 6 months out.>

## Roles

The captain-picard fleet (from [`jhgaylor/aod-specs`](https://github.com/jhgaylor/aod-specs)) has eight specialists. List below the subset this team uses and a one-line "when to dispatch" note for each:

- <TODO: role-name> — <TODO: when to dispatch>
- <TODO: role-name> — <TODO: when to dispatch>
- <TODO: role-name> — <TODO: when to dispatch>

(Default fleet — keep what applies, drop the rest:)

- `customer-researcher` — when validating a problem, framing, or user need before committing engineering effort.
- `growth-marketer` — when crafting launch narratives, press-release-first specs, or growth experiments.
- `designer` — when interaction or visual design needs to land before engineering.
- `general-purpose-engineer` — for typical feature, bug, and refactor work.
- `pr-reviewer` — to review specialist PRs before merge when the orchestrator wants a second opinion.
- `release-validator` — to gate a deploy on functional + smoke-test passes.
- `reliability-engineer` — to investigate incidents, set up observability, or harden hot paths.
- `product-analyst` — to query PostHog/Honeycomb for evidence before/after a change.

## Gates

The orchestrator stops at every gate listed below and waits for the human operator to make the call. Don't add gates the team won't actually defend — every extra gate is friction.

- **G0** — <TODO: what decision happens here?>
- **G1** — <TODO: what decision happens here?>
- **G2** — <TODO: what decision happens here?>
- **G3** — <TODO: what decision happens here?>

(Default ladder for a new product:)

- **G0** — Pick a product direction. Stops after `phase-0-framing`. Human picks the option.
- **G1** — Press-release narrative locked. Stops after the growth-marketer drafts the launch narrative. Human approves direction.
- **G2** — Architecture and engineering plan locked. Stops after engineer + designer produce a build plan. Human approves scope.
- **G3** — Ready to ship. Stops before public launch. Human gives go/no-go.

## Brief format

The orchestrator dispatches specialists with a written brief at `plan/<slice>/<role>-brief.md`. Keep briefs under 30 lines.

```
## Context
<2–4 lines — what slice, what's been decided, what specialist needs to know>

## Task
<bullets — concrete deliverables>

## Acceptance
<bullets — how the orchestrator will verify the PR is done>

## Out of scope
<bullets — things the specialist must NOT do in this PR>
```

## Working agreements

- **Every change to this repo lands as a PR.** No specialist pushes to `main`. The orchestrator merges after acceptance.
- **The orchestrator pushes after every state change.** Briefs, ROADMAP edits, and ADRs that aren't pushed are invisible to the next conversation.
- **Two slices in flight max.** If `ROADMAP.md`'s "Now" has two entries, finish one before dispatching another.
- **Decisions become ADRs.** When something gets contentious or needs to constrain future work, write `decisions/NNNN-<title>.md`. Use [`decisions/0001-template.md`](decisions/0001-template.md).

<TODO: add product-specific working agreements here — observability, deploy targets, code style, security gates, etc.>
